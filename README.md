Recipe Repo is a small personal project that I use to explore new patterns, practices, and techniques for developing clean code. The emphasis is on test-first TDD for the server side code, which is a RESTful api in ASP.NET Web API.  The backend is a small, custom JSON repository.

For now, the font end is a Backbone.js project for state management with Require.js for dependency loading and Handlebars.js for templating.  As I continue working on the project I will also add a front end project for AngularJS, too.
